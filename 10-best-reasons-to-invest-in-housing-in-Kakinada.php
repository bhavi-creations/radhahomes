                                    <h2>10 best reasons to invest in housing in Kakinada</h2>
                                    <div class="bl__dtl">
                                            <p class="pjust">Kakinada is the headquarters of the East Godavari District, a rich belt of Andhra Pradesh with green fields and a complex network of canals established by the British before Independence. It is known as the rice bowl of Andhra Pradesh and lies on the coast of the Bay of Bengal. Kakinada is one of India's most populous tier-2 cities. Telugu is the preferred language among the locals.</p>
                                 
                                        <p class="pjust">It is a holy pilgrimage site with a long history, magnificent natural beauty, and historical significance! The Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary, in addition to lovely beaches and hillocks, stunning scenery, and relaxing rivers, can be found in Kakinada.

</p>
<p class="pjust">Due to its position as a Special Economic Zone, the city is fast expanding. Investing in real estate in this area is advantageous for a variety of reasons, ten of which we will discuss below.</p>
                                       </div>
                                       
                                       <div class="bl__dtl pt--10" >
                                           <ul >
                              <li class="pt--10 p"><h3><b> 1. Smart city</b></h3>  

<p class="pt--10 pjust">Andhra Pradesh's Smart Cities Mission has designated it as one of the three smart cities in the state. GMR Group is building a second new port, which will eventually become the state's largest. The Indian government is building a petroleum complex since the area is rich in natural gas and petroleum. It is India's fastest-growing city. </p>
</li>

<li class="pt--10 p"><h3><b>2. SEZ</b></h3>  

<p class="pt--10 pjust">The land regulations, property registration procedure, property taxes, and all other legal requirements will be reduced now that the city has been designated as a Special Economic Zone. Commercial possibilities will also increase. As a result, any residential or business property in Kakinada could be considered a solid investment opportunity. Thousands of employment in manufacturing and other industries will be created as a result of the project's completion. This will boost infrastructure and civic amenities, as well as pave the path for rapid real estate development in Kakinada. As a result of the trend of development in these sectors, the country's best builders have begun to come to the city in search of profitable residential projects. </p></li>

<li class="pt--10 p"><h3><b>3. Industries</b></h3>  

<p class="pt--10 pjust">Kakinada's economy has shifted dramatically from a time when it was entirely reliant on automotive parts, steel industry-related businesses, and agricultural sectors to a time when fertilisers, rice, oil mills, fish, and associated items were strongly established. Exports and imports are both increasing, as this is how a lot of business is done. </p>
</li>
<li class="pt--10 p"><h3><b>4. IT Hub</b></h3>  

<p class="pt--10 pjust">Kakinada is a city in India's tier II. In 2007, the Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) opened a facility here. Since then, a number of IT firms have sprung up in the area, owing to the city's educated workforce. </p>

<p class="pt--10 pjust">Kakinada is home to almost 35 software and IT enterprises. Cyient, Avineon, Krify, Primesoft, and other significant software companies are among them.
</li>
<li class="pt--10 p"><h3><b>5. Education</b></h3>  

<p class="pt--10 pjust">The existence of a number of educational institutes in Kakinada is rewarding the expanding educational command of the people by delivering the best education to the people. The establishment and expansion of a large number of high-quality secondary educational institutions have raised education levels. Some of the well-known institutions include Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University and Rangaraya Medical College. </p>
</li>
<li class="pt--10 p"><h3><b>6. Temple street</b></h3>  

<p class="pt--10 pjust">Kakinada's title as the best-planned city is bolstered by the existence of Temple Street, a dedicated avenue for temples. Shivalayam, Vishnalayam, and Geetha Mandiram are some of the temples on this street. It's also known as "Pensioner's Paradise" because of its lovely environment and relaxing ambience. </p>
</li>
<li class="pt--10 p"><h3><b>7. Beaches</b></h3>  

<p class="pt--10 pjust">Uppada Beach is well known as Kakinada Beach, which has one of the longest coastlines of India. Kakinada beach is known for its calm blue seas and frequent breeze. The ships on the beach at night make it colourful and vibrant. </p>
</li>
<li class="pt--10 p"><h3><b>8. Climate</b></h3>  

<p class="pt--10 pjust">The climate of Kakinada is tropical savanna, with hot, humid weather for most of the year. Late May and early June are the hottest months of the year, with maximum temperatures of 38–42 °C (100–108 °F). The coldest month is January, with low temperatures of 18–20 °C (64–68 °F). The southwest monsoon provides the majority of the city's seasonal rainfall. </p>
</li>
<li class="pt--10 p"><h3><b>9. Wildlife Sanctuary</b></h3>  

<p class="pt--10 pjust">With 24 mangrove tree varieties and more than 120 bird species, the Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary near Kakinada is India's second-largest stretch of mangrove forests. The white-backed vulture and the long-billed vulture can be found here, both of which are nearly extinct. Aside from birds, the sanctuary is home to a strong breeding population of smooth-coated otters, golden jackals, sea turtles, and fishing cats. Every year, from January to March, olive ridley sea turtles lay their eggs in an 18-kilometre-long sand trench at the sanctuary. </p>
</li>
<li class="pt--10 p"><h3><b>10. Road connectivity</b></h3>  

<p class="pt--10 pjust">Kakinada is connected to other major cities via the National Highway No. 214, which provides for healthy transportation. This route runs from Kathipudi to Pamurru and connects Kakinada, Razole Sinchinada, and Narasapur. </p>
</li>
</ul>
